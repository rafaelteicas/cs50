# Python is simpler than C, to do the same thing we just need:
print("hello, world")
# Instead of compiler Python is an interpreted language, so you can run this code directly using the Python interpreter.
# The interpreter reads and executes the code line by line.
# This code is interpreted to a bytecode that the Python virtual machine can execute.
# Virtual Machine is an abstraction of a physical machine that executes bytecode instructions.
