# print("hello, world) # When you run the code you have a SyntaxError:
# SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
# SyntaxError is a error that you need go to code and fix it, but you have other type of errors, the runtime errors.
# Runtime errors happen when you code is running and the programming needs to code defensively to preview those kind of errors, and avoid to run.
